Getting the detection correct

In person_detector.py:

   # Parameters for person detection
        self.cluster_distance = 0.01  # Distance between points in a cluster
        self.min_cluster_size = 6    # Minimum points to be considered a person
        self.max_cluster_size = 125 # Maximum points to be considered a person
  need to be changed 

   def filter_person_clusters(self, clusters):
        person_clusters = []
        
        for cluster in clusters:
            # Calculate cluster properties
            cluster_size = len(cluster)
            if not (self.min_cluster_size <= cluster_size <= self.max_cluster_size):
                continue
                
            min_x, min_y = np.min(cluster, axis=0)
            max_x, max_y = np.max(cluster, axis=0)
            width = max_x - min_x
            depth = max_y - min_y
            
            area = width * depth
            density = cluster_size / area if area > 0 else 0
            aspect_ratio = width / depth if depth > 0 else 0
            
            is_person = (
                (0.1 <= width <= 0.8) or (0.1 <= depth <= 0.8) #and
                #not (width > 3 or depth > 3)                   
                #0.6 <= aspect_ratio <= 3   # People are roughly circular/oval in lidar view
                #density >= 100 and              # Dense enough to be a person
                #cluster_size >= self.min_cluster_size and  # Minimum size check
                #cluster_size <= self.max_cluster_size      # Maximum size check
            )
            
            if is_person:
                person_clusters.append(cluster)
                print("density: ",density)
        
        return person_clusters

the logic here needs to improve. I am close but not quite, I either detect nothing or the person + false positives from the wall
